    <h1> Saturn by SZA </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        If there's another universe<br>
        Please make some noise (noise)<br>
        Give me a sign (sign)<br>
        This can't be life<br>
        If there's a point to losing love<br>
        Repeating pain (why?)<br>
        It's all the same<br>
        I hate this place
    </p>
    <p>
        Stuck in this paradigm<br>
        Don't believe in paradise<br>
        This must be what Hell is like<br>
        There's got to be more, got to be more<br>
        Sick of this head of mine<br>
        Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze<br>
        Nirvana's not as advertised<br>
        There's got to be more, been here before
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>
        Ooh (ooh, ooh)<br>
        Life's better on <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/">Saturn</a><br>
        Got to break this pattern<br>
        Of floating away<br>
        Ooh (ooh, ooh)<br>
        Find something worth saving<br>
        It's all for the taking<br>
        I always say
    </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll be better on Saturn<br>
        None of this matters<br>
        Dreaming of Saturn, oh
    </p>
    <p>
        If karma's really real<br>
        How am I still here?<br>
        Just seems so unfair<br>
        I could be wrong though<br>
        If there's a point to being good<br>
        Then where's my reward?<br>
        The good die young and poor<br>
        I gave it all I could
    </p>
    <p>
        Stuck in this terradome<br>
        All I see is terrible<br>
        Making us hysterical<br>
        There's got to be more, got to be more<br>
        Sick of this head of mine<br>
        Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>'s not as advertised<br>
        There's got to be more, been here before
